## Code Modification 1

- Added error handling when the the import data can not be stored as a float.

## Code Modification 2

- Identify those invalid data and collect them in a list.

## Code Modification 3

- In the test, average_transaction_amount = total_transaction_amount / transaction_counter does not work because the divisor is 0ï¼ŒAnd the dividend is also 0.

- The cause of this bug is in line 75. In this if loop, the new customer ID will only be created, and no deposit or withdrawal will be executed. Therefore, add the execution of deposit or withdraw to the script for creating a new account.

- After the repair is completed, you need to assign a value to transaction_counter, so assign a value to transaction_counter in line 121.
